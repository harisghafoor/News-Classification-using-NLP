# News Classification using NLP:
In this project, we are going to predict the category of news article by using NLP techniques. We started off from cleaning the dataset and pre-processing the feature space. In EDA, we found the word length of each article to gain some insights and then we found the most repititive word and their importance in the articles using word-cloud. The word embedding technique also play very important role and as instructed we employed TF-IDF technique for converting text into integers. Then we built different predictive models and trained our dataset. Evaluation metrics play very important role because of the nature of dataset. As we can see in the EDA that our dataset is highly imbalanced so we cant use classification accuracy but we will use confusion matrix and classification report in order to evaluate the dataset. Our best performing models are Decision Trees,xGBclassifier and Multinomial Naive Bayes.
